# crud

In general CRUD means performing Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete operations on a table in a database. So I have developed one crud app in which user can do the crud operations. In this crud view I have used djangoes function based views and I have used bootstrap and popper.js and jquery.js to make it representable.

In this project student can register themselves by filling out form and their data will be shown in table list on web page.
and by clicking edit button we can go for performing update operations over database. 
And for delete operation there is a delete button given to perform delete operations over students data.
Retrieved data is available over web page in table format. That makes convenience.
